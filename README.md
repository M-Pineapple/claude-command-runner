## Overview

Claude Command Runner revolutionises the development workflow by allowing Claude to:
- Execute terminal commands directly from conversations
- Chain commands with conditional logic using pipelines
- Stream output in real-time for long builds
- Save and reuse command templates with variables
- Automatically capture output with intelligent timing
- Track command history and patterns
- Read/write the macOS clipboard
- Probe environment context (git, venv, Docker, Node)
- Parse command output into structured JSON
- Manage workspace profiles per project
- Orchestrate multiple terminal tabs
- Watch files and trigger commands on changes
- Execute commands on remote hosts via SSH

## 🎯 Key Features

### Command Pipelines
Chain multiple commands with intelligent failure handling:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"name": "Build", "command": "swift build", "on_fail": "stop"},
    {"name": "Test", "command": "swift test", "on_fail": "continue"},
    {"name": "Package", "command": "swift build -c release", "on_fail": "stop"}
  ]
}
```

**Failure modes:**
- `stop` – Halt pipeline on failure
- `continue` – Log error and proceed to next step
- `warn` – Show warning and continue

### Output Streaming
Real-time output for long-running commands:

```json
{
  "command": "swift build -c release",
  "update_interval": 3,
  "max_duration": 180
}
```

Perfect for:
- Long compilation processes
- Test suites
- Any command that previously "hung" waiting for output

### Command Templates
Save reusable patterns with variable substitution:

```json
// Save a template
{
  "name": "swift-release",
  "template": "cd {{project}} && swift build -c release",
  "category": "Swift Development",
  "description": "Build Swift project in release mode"
}

// Run with variables
{
  "name": "swift-release",
  "variables": {"project": "~/GitHub/MyApp"}
}
```

Templates are stored in `~/.claude-command-runner/templates.json` and persist across sessions.

### Smart Auto-Retrieve
The `execute_with_auto_retrieve` command intelligently detects command types and adjusts wait times:
- **Quick commands** (echo, pwd): 2-6 seconds
- **Moderate commands** (git, npm): up to 20 seconds  
- **Build commands** (swift build, make): up to 77 seconds
- **Test commands**: up to 40 seconds

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What's new in v5.0.0?
**A:** Ten new feature categories bringing the tool count from 12 to 30. Highlights include clipboard integration, macOS notifications, environment intelligence, structured output parsing, workspace profiles, multi-terminal sessions, file watchers, and SSH remote execution. See the full changelog for details.

### Q: When should I use pipelines vs regular commands?
**A:** Use pipelines when you need:
- Multiple sequential commands
- Conditional logic (stop on build failure, continue on test failure)
- A summary of all steps with timing
- CI/CD-style workflows

### Q: Why does my command "hang" with execute_with_auto_retrieve?
**A:** For very long commands, use `execute_with_streaming` instead. It provides real-time output updates and handles commands that run for minutes. This was the main motivation for adding streaming in v4.0.

### Q: How do I use templates with multiple variables?
**A:** Define variables in your template with `{{variable_name}}` syntax:
```json
{
  "template": "cd {{project}} && git checkout {{branch}} && swift build -c {{config}}"
}
```
Then provide all variables when running:
```json
{
  "variables": {"project": "~/MyApp", "branch": "main", "config": "release"}
}
```

### Q: Where are my templates stored?
**A:** In `~/.claude-command-runner/templates.json`. They persist across sessions and Claude Desktop restarts.

### Q: How long will auto-retrieve wait for my command?
**A:** It depends on the command type:
- Simple commands: 6 seconds
- Git/npm commands: 20 seconds
- Build commands: 77 seconds
- Unknown commands: 30 seconds

For longer commands, use `execute_with_streaming` instead.

### Q: Can I use this with Terminal.app or iTerm2?
**A:** Yes, basic command execution works with any terminal. However, automatic output capture and advanced features require Warp Terminal. [Get Warp free here](https://app.warp.dev/referral/G9W3EY).

### Q: Is it secure to let Claude run commands?
**A:** Commands are sent directly to your terminal and execute automatically — there is no manual "press Enter" step. However, you can configure blocked commands and patterns in the config file to prevent dangerous operations. Always review the command Claude proposes before confirming in the chat interface.

### Q: What happens if a pipeline step fails?
**A:** Depends on the `on_fail` setting:
- `stop` – Pipeline halts immediately, remaining steps are skipped
- `continue` – Error is logged, pipeline continues to next step
- `warn` – Warning is shown, pipeline continues

### Q: Can I nest pipelines or run templates inside pipelines?
**A:** Not directly in v4.0, but you can create templates that contain multiple commands separated by `&&` or `;`.

### Q: Where is my command history stored?
**A:** In an SQLite database at `~/.claude-command-runner/claude_commands.db`. It tracks all commands, outputs, exit codes, and execution times.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### macOS Permission Error: "osascript is not allowed to send keystrokes" (Error 1002)

This error occurs when macOS blocks AppleScript automation. It's common after fresh macOS installs, major updates (like Sequoia), or when the Automation permissions cache becomes corrupted.

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed to send keystrokes. (1002)`
- Toggling permissions off/on in System Settings doesn't help
- No permission prompt appears when the MCP tries to run

**Solution:**

1. **Reset Automation permissions** (this resets ALL Automation permissions, not just for this app):
   ```bash
   tccutil reset AppleEvents
   ```

2. **Full Mac restart** (not just logout – a complete restart is required)

3. **Open your terminal app first** (Warp, WarpPreview, or whichever you use)

4. **Open Claude Desktop**

5. **Trigger the permission prompt manually** by running this in Terminal:
   ```bash
   osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "x"'
   ```

6. **Grant permission** when macOS prompts you

7. **Try the MCP command again** – it should now work and Claude.app will appear in the Automation list

**Note:** A simple toggle reset or targeted `tccutil` command often doesn't work – the full AppleEvents reset plus restart is usually required.

**Bundle ID Reference:** Claude Desktop uses `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop`

---

### macOS Accessibility Permission Required for Multi-Terminal Sessions

The multi-terminal tools (`open_terminal_tab`, `send_to_session`, `close_session`) use System Events UI scripting, which requires the MCP binary to have **Accessibility** permission.

**Symptoms:**
- Error message: `osascript is not allowed assistive access. (-1719)`
- Multi-terminal tools fail while other tools (clipboard, SSH, environment context) work fine

**Solution:**

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Click the **+** button and navigate to your `claude-command-runner` binary:
   ```
   /path/to/claude-command-runner/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/claude-command-runner
   ```
3. The `.build` folder is hidden by default — press **Cmd+Shift+.** in Finder to reveal it
4. Toggle the permission **on** for the binary

**Important:** macOS tracks Accessibility permissions by binary identity. After every `swift build`, the binary changes and you must **re-add it** to the Accessibility list. This only affects the multi-terminal session tools — all other tools work without Accessibility permission.

---

### MCP Not Responding
1. Check if the server is running: `lsof -i :9876`
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Rebuild with `./build.sh`

### Commands Not Appearing in Terminal
1. Ensure Warp/WarpPreview is running
2. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors
3. Verify your MCP configuration path

### Streaming Not Updating
1. Check that the command is actually running (not waiting for input)
2. Increase `update_interval` if updates are too frequent
3. Check `/tmp/claude_stream_*.log` for output files

### Pipeline Steps Skipped Unexpectedly
1. Check the `on_fail` setting – `stop` will skip remaining steps
2. Verify each command works individually first
3. Check exit codes in the pipeline summary

### Templates Not Saving
1. Ensure `~/.claude-command-runner/` directory exists
2. Check write permissions on templates.json
3. Verify JSON syntax in template definition

### Auto-Retrieve Not Working
1. Ensure you're using `execute_with_auto_retrieve` (not `execute_command`)
2. Check if command output file exists: `ls /tmp/claude_output_*.json`
3. For long commands, use `execute_with_streaming` instead

### Database Issues
If commands execute but aren't saved to the database:

1. **Check database integrity**:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 ~/.claude-command-runner/claude_commands.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
   ```
   
2. **If corrupted**, backup and remove:
   ```bash
   mv ~/.claude-command-runner/claude_commands.db ~/.claude-command-runner/claude_commands.db.backup
   # Restart Claude Desktop - a new database will be created automatically
   ```
